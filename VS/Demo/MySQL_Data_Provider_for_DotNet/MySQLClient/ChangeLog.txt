		result was returned.

	Improved: MySQLClient recognizes if libmysql.dll from v3.x or v4.x is used and handles it

2003-04-19:
	Corrected: CPrototypes.ConvertMySQLValue did not catch error in case of wrong conversion.
	
	Changed: Parsing algorithm for connection string. Now supports
		Address: "server, "address", "location"

		User: "user", "user id", "uid"
		Password: "password", "pwd":
		Connection timeout: "connection timeout", "timeout"
	
	
Todo:
-----

1) Unique Key is not recognized because MySQL doesn't return the MULTIPLE_KEY_FLAG in the
field definition. Research in progress.

2) Component part for Connection, Command, DataAdapter should be done.
